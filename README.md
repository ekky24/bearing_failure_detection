# Machine Failure Detection

The purpose of this project is building anomaly detection model to act as an early warning system and avoid the declined productivity due to machine failure.

## Introduction

Machine Learning have so many potential to be applied in many areas in order to lowering the cost, increasing productivity, avoiding errors, and much more. One of those area that could benefits from the advancement of Machine Learning is Predictive Maintenance (PDM).

With PDM, we use potentially many process parameters gained from online sensors to determine if our equipment is moving away from stable operating conditions and is heading towards failure. Therefore, the purpose of this project is building an anomaly detection model to act as an early warning system and avoid the declined productivity due to machine failure.

## Dataset

This project use vibration sensor readings from NASA Acoustics and Vibration Database. Sensor readings were taken on four bearings that were run to failure under constant load and running conditions. The vibration measurement signals are provided for the datasets over the lifetime of the bearings until failure.
